I still remember during the high school results, how confused I was to opt for B.TECH or BCA as my graduation. Latching up to become an Engineer, I found, I could not be a developer or a coder regardless whatsoever were the opportunities. Becoming a front-end person, dealing with clients, communicating with high profiles, and generating business and revenue at the end were the new interests.\n\nThis passion carried me through my education and helped me complete my Master's degree in Marketing. During this time, there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined. I studied different parameters of business, managerial skills like leadership, keeping up with motivation, teamwork, soft skills, and practical knowledge related to sales and marketing.\n\nI have enjoyed many executive positions throughout my career in diverse fields and keeping up with different KRAs all the time, namely \u2013 Customer Service, Advertising, Operations, Logistics, Sales, Retail, SEO, and Digital Marketing.\n\nLuckily, I am in this ever-booming IT industry and consulting IT professionals who want to grow their careers with some IT certification. I connect with great people and find them an excellent career path with the right badge. \n\nI am the colleague at work that everyone wants to know, but nobody wants to be, as it takes the right amount of personal time and effort to be everyone's go-to. If you're going to get something done or stuck at some process, you come to me \u2013 Everyone knows that!!\n\nThere's undoubtedly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve and I am open to taking necessary life-changing steps. \n\nProfessional Skills: Business Development | LinkedIn Marketing | Corporate Relations | Sales | Digital Marketing | IT Certifications | Team Player \n\nPersonal Traits: Constantly Learning | Stay calm yet keeping the determination | Focused on making the Best of interests Decisions | Passionate enough to drive through critical situations | Keeping Professional Instincts\n\nUpskilling / New Interest: Entrepreneurship, Facebook Marketing, Arabic Language, Recruitment",
